    <h1>Terms of Service - MiniJem</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: November 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the MiniJem mobile application ("App") and its services, developed by Joseph Teoh ("Developer," "we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <p>MiniJem allows users to create, share, and discover short audio recordings ("Gems") paired with cover photos. Gems can include spoken content, singing, humming, or other audio up to 15 minutes. Users may reply with audio to build conversations. The App is provided for personal, non-commercial use unless otherwise specified.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age in your country) to use the App. By using it, you represent that you meet this requirement and have the authority to agree to these Terms. Parents/guardians are responsible for their children's use.</p>

    <h2>2. Account and Security</h2>
    <p>To create an account, you provide accurate information (e.g., email). You are responsible for maintaining confidentiality of your login credentials.</p>
    <p>You agree not to share accounts, impersonate others, or use automated tools (e.g., bots) to access the App.</p>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate accounts for violations without notice.</p>

    <h2>3. User Content and Licenses</h2>

    <h3>a. Your Content</h3>
    <p>You retain ownership of your Gems, audio replies, photos, and other content ("User Content").</p>
    <p>By posting User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license to host, display, reproduce, and distribute it for App functionality (e.g., feeds, recommendations). This includes sublicensing to third-party providers for storage/delivery.</p>
    <p>You are solely responsible for User Content. It must not violate laws or these Terms.</p>

    <h3>b. Our Content</h3>
    <p>The App's design, code, trademarks (e.g., "MiniJem"), and non-User Content are owned by us or licensors. You may not copy, modify, or commercially exploit them without permission.</p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Post illegal, harmful, abusive, harassing, or defamatory content (e.g., hate speech, threats).</li>
        <li>Infringe intellectual property rights (e.g., unauthorized singing of copyrighted songs; we encourage fair use but cannot verify).</li>
        <li>Spam, upload viruses, or disrupt the App.</li>
        <li>Engage in commercial activities without our consent (e.g., no ads in Gems).</li>
        <li>Collect user data without permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We may remove violating content and report to authorities. Audio content (e.g., singing) must comply with copyright laws; you indemnify us for claims arising from your User Content.</p>

    <h2>5. Community Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Foster a positive space:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be respectful in replies.</li>
        <li>No explicit/NSFW content unless appropriately tagged (we reserve removal rights).</li>
        <li>Report abuse via in-app tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>We respect copyrights. If you believe content infringes, notify us at <a href="mailto:support@minijem.app">support@minijem.app</a> with DMCA details. We respond to valid notices.</p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>

    <h3>a. Disclaimers</h3>
    <p>The App is provided "AS IS" without warranties (express or implied). We do not guarantee uninterrupted access, error-free operation, or that content is accurate/appropriate.</p>
    <p>User Content is user-generated; we are not liable for it.</p>

    <h3>b. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (e.g., lost data, emotional distress) arising from App use.</p>
    <p>Total liability shall not exceed $100 USD.</p>
    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations; they may not apply to you.</p>

    <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising from your User Content, violations of these Terms, or misuse of the App.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access anytime for violations. Upon termination, your license ends; we may retain data for legal reasons.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of California, USA, without regard to conflict principles. Disputes shall be resolved via binding arbitration in San Francisco, under AAA rules. You waive class actions. For small claims under $10,000, courts in [County] apply.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms. Continued use constitutes acceptance. We'll notify via App or email for material changes.</p>

    <h2>12. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p><strong>Severability:</strong> Invalid provisions do not affect others.</p>
    <p><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms supersede prior agreements.</p>
    <p><strong>Contact:</strong> For questions, email <a href="mailto:support@minijem.app">support@minijem.app</a>.</p>

    <p>Thank you for using MiniJem. We hope your Gems shine!</p>
