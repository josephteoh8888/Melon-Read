    <h1>Privacy Policy - MiniJem</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: November 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to MiniJem ("the App," "we," "us," or "our"). MiniJem is a social audio application developed by Joseph Teoh ("Developer") that allows users to create, share, and discover short audio recordings ("Gems") paired with cover photos. These Gems can include spoken thoughts, singing, humming, or other audio content up to 15 minutes in length. Users can engage in asynchronous audio replies to foster community conversations.</p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we handle your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, how we share it, and your rights. By using the App, you consent to the practices described here. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <p>This Policy applies only to the MiniJem App and our associated services. It does not apply to third-party websites or apps you may access through links in the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information to provide, improve, and personalize the App. We minimize data collection to what is necessary for core functionality.</p>

    <h3>a. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
    <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your username, email address, and profile picture (optional). You may also provide a bio or display name.</p>
    <p><strong>User Content (Gems):</strong> When you create a Gem, we collect the audio file, associated cover photo, caption, topic tags (e.g., health, singing), and metadata like duration and creation timestamp. Audio replies to other Gems are treated similarly.</p>
    <p><strong>Communication Data:</strong> If you contact us via email or in-app support, we collect your email and message details.</p>

    <h3>b. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <p><strong>Device and Usage Data:</strong> We collect device identifiers (e.g., IP address, device type, OS version), app version, crash reports, and usage analytics (e.g., number of Gems created/listened to, session duration) to improve performance and debug issues. This does not include personal identifiers unless tied to your account.</p>
    <p><strong>Location Data:</strong> We do not collect precise location data. Approximate location may be inferred from IP address for content recommendations (e.g., region-specific topics), but only if you enable it.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> The App uses local storage for session management. We do not use cookies for tracking.</p>

    <h3>c. Information from Third Parties</h3>
    <p>We do not integrate with third-party social logins (e.g., Apple Sign-In is optional and follows Apple's privacy rules). If you share Gems via external apps (e.g., Messages), that data is handled by those services.</p>

    <p>We do not collect sensitive personal information (e.g., health data, racial/ethnic origin) unless you voluntarily include it in a Gem's audio or caption, in which case it is treated as User Content.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information solely to operate and enhance the App:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To create and manage your account and Gems.</li>
        <li>To deliver personalized feeds, recommendations, and audio replies.</li>
        <li>To enable background playback, notifications (e.g., new replies), and social features.</li>
        <li>To analyze usage patterns for bug fixes and feature improvements (anonymized where possible).</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations, prevent fraud, or enforce our Terms of Use.</li>
        <li>To respond to your support inquiries.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do not use your data for targeted advertising or sell it to third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information for marketing purposes. Sharing is limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> When you share a Gem publicly or via direct links, it becomes visible to other users. Audio replies are shared with the original poster and their thread participants.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share anonymized data with trusted third-party vendors (e.g., cloud storage like AWS for audio files, analytics tools like Firebase for crash reporting). These providers are contractually bound to protect your data and use it only for App-related purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or to protect our rights, safety, or property (e.g., in response to abuse reports).</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your data may be transferred, but we'll notify you first.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All audio and photo content is stored securely with end-to-end encryption for transmissions between devices. Gems are not stored on central servers beyond what's necessary for delivery.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your data, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encryption of audio files in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest.</li>
        <li>Access controls to limit employee/vendor access.</li>
        <li>Regular security audits.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, no system is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, and you use the App at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> Retained as long as your account is active. You can delete your account anytime; we'll remove your data within 30 days (except for legal backups).</li>
        <li><strong>User Content:</strong> Gems are retained until you delete them or your account. Publicly shared Gems may be cached for performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Anonymized logs retained for up to 2 years for analytics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location (e.g., GDPR in EU, CCPA in California), you may have rights to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access, correct, or delete your personal data.</li>
        <li>Opt out of data processing or targeted recommendations.</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent (where applicable).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To exercise these, email us at <a href="mailto:support@minijem.app">support@minijem.app</a>. We'll respond within 30 days. For California residents, you can also request disclosures under CCPA.</p>
    <p>You can manage app permissions (e.g., microphone access) via iOS Settings. We do not track "Do Not Track" signals.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>MiniJem is not intended for children under 13 (or 16 in some regions). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn of such collection, we'll delete it promptly. Parents/guardians can contact us for assistance.</p>

    <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>The App is hosted in the United States. If you use it from outside, your data may cross borders. We ensure adequate protections (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) for transfers.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy periodically. Significant changes will be notified via in-app alerts or email. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For questions, concerns, or to exercise rights, email <a href="mailto:support@minijem.app">support@minijem.app</a>. We're based at [Your Address, if required; e.g., a virtual one for compliance].</p>

    <p>Thank you for trusting MiniJem. We value your voice and privacy.</p>
